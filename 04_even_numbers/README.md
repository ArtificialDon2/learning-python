# Task 04 - Even Numbers

## Prompt
- Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.
- Make sure there are no duplicates and the order is ascending.

## Notes
- `if item % 2 == 0` -> if the item divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 0.
- `sort()` -> sorts the list ascending by default.
- `f" "` -> formatted string lets you include values inside a string directly using placeholders `{}`.
